>>>Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage application state.

>>>React uses Redux for building the user interface.

>>>Redux was first introduced by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark in 2015.

>>>React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. 

>>>React Redux allows React components to read data from a Redux Store,
   and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. 

>>>Redux helps apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model. 

>>>React Redux is conceptually simple. 

>>>React Redux subscribes to the Redux store, 
   checks to see if the data which your component wants have changed, 
   and re-renders your component.
